Hi, my name is Erik Rudhe and I am a 26 year old person who has just graduated
with a master degree in media technology from Linköpings universitet, campus

I have developed both creatively and technically. Im now on the hunt for an 
exciting and intressenting job as a software developer, preferbly in the web development area. 

I enjoy taking on complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful
interface design solutions. I also enjoy working with the logic and structure
of coding and always strive to whrite elegant and efficient code, weather it
to be HTML, CSS and JavaScript or C++. 

When Im not working or studying, you will probably find me in the climbing 
gym or outdoors looking for some adventure.
